## Eitri Machine v.3.3.0

### New features

#### Support for calling services and components upon starting an Eitri-App

On Android, the `RunInput` model now has a propriedade `#!kotlin intentFlags: Int?`, allowing native screens or services to be called upon starting an eitri-app.

#### Listing and cancelling scheduled notifications

It is now possible to list and remove notifications scheduled by `#!js async Eitri.notification.sendLocalPush()`. you can perform these actions through two new methods, `#!js async Eitri.notification.listLocalPushes(): Promise<NotificationSchedules>` and `#!js async Eitri.notification.cancelLocalPush(): Promise<void>`.
An usage example of listLocalPushes is as follows√á

```js
let localPushes = await Eitri.notification.listLocalPushes();
console.log(localPushes);

/* Example output from this console.log:
{
  schedules: [
    { nextOccurrence: "Feb 14, 2025 4:07:58 PM", notification: {...} },
    { nextOccurrence: "Feb 15, 2025 10:00:00 AM", notification: {...} }
  ]
}
*/
```

`cancelLocalPush` is used as such:

```js
await Eitri.notification.cancelLocalPush({ id: "1" });
```

#### eitri-app reload

You can now reload an eitri-app by using `#!js async Eitri.navigation.reload(): Promise<void>`.

#### Bottom bar simulation

Eitri Play can now simulate bottom bars to help development in cases where there are multiple workspaces

<img style="height: 540px !important; display: block; margin: 0 auto; align-self: center !important;" src="../assets/gifs/bottomBarSim.gif"/>

### Fixes

#### Memory Leak in bottom bars

A memory leak that affected bottom bar views on Android was fixed

#### Bottom bar stops working after running the app for a long time

An error present exclusively on iOS that made the eitri-app's bottom bar stop opening or closing after running the eitri-app for a long duration of time caused by RAM management problems, was fixed.

#### Fixes Eitri Doctor confirmation model

Fixes logic in Eitri Doctor's `PromptModal.jsx` component so it can now open.

<Image
    src={img}
    loading="ondemand"
    width="100%"
    dataCy="image-width"
    marginBottom="small"
/>

```

```jsx

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map((index) => (
    <ImageView
      loading="ondemand"
      width="20%"
      aspectRatio="1:1"
      key={"image_${index}"}
      src={"http://lorempixel.com.br/800/800/?${index}"}
      borderRadius="pill"
      borderWidth="hairline"
	/>
))

```
